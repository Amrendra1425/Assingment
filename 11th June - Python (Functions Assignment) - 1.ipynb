Lambda Function vs. Regular Function**\n","\n","A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned.\n","\n","**Regular functions** are defined using the `def` keyword and can contain multiple expressions and statements.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","# Regular function\n","def add(a, b):\n","    return a + b\n","\n","# Lambda function\n","add_lambda = lambda a, b: a + b\n","\n","print(add(2, 3))        # Output: 5\n","print(add_lambda(2, 3)) # Output: 5\n","```\n","\n","**2. Lambda Function with Multiple Arguments**\n","\n","Yes, a lambda function can have multiple arguments.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","# Lambda function with multiple arguments\n","multiply = lambda x, y: x * y\n","print(multiply(3, 4))  # Output: 12\n","```\n","\n","**3. Typical Use of Lambda Functions**\n","\n","Lambda functions are often used in places where a small, throwaway function is needed. Common use cases include using them with `map`, `filter`, and `sorted`.\n","\n","Example use case:\n","```python\n","# Using lambda with map\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","squares = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n","print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n","```\n","\n","**4. Advantages and Limitations of Lambda Functions**\n","\n","**Advantages**:\n","- Concise and syntactically compact.\n","- Useful for short-lived operations and callbacks.\n","\n","**Limitations**:\n","- Limited to a single expression.\n","- Can be less readable and harder to debug.\n","- Lack of function name makes stack traces harder to interpret.\n","\n","**5. Accessing Variables Outside Scope**\n","\n","Yes, lambda functions can access variables from the surrounding scope.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","# Accessing outer scope variable\n","def make_incrementor(n):\n","    return lambda x: x + n\n","\n","increment_by_2 = make_incrementor(2)\n","print(increment_by_2(3))  # Output: 5\n","```\n","\n","**6. Lambda Function to Calculate Square**\n","\n","```python\n","square = lambda x: x ** 2\n","print(square(5))  # Output: 25\n","```\n","\n","**7. Lambda Function to Find Maximum Value in a List**\n","\n","```python\n","max_value = lambda lst: max(lst)\n","print(max_value([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 5\n","```\n","\n","**8. Lambda Function to Filter Even Numbers**\n","\n","```python\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n","print(evens)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n","```\n","\n","**9. Lambda Function to Sort List of Strings by Length**\n","\n","```python\n","strings = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\"]\n","sorted_strings = sorted(strings, key=lambda s: len(s))\n","print(sorted_strings)  # Output: ['date', 'apple', 'cherry', 'banana']\n","```\n","\n","**10. Lambda Function for Common Elements Between Two Lists**\n","\n","```python\n","common_elements = lambda lst1, lst2: list(filter(lambda x: x in lst2, lst1))\n","print(common_elements([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]))  # Output: [2, 3]\n","```\n","\n","### Recursive Functions in Python\n","\n","**11.
