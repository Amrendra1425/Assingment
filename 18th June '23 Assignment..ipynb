Role of the 'else' Block in a Try-Except Statement\n","\n","The `else` block in a `try-except` statement runs only if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. It's useful for code that should run only if the `try` block succeeds.\n","\n","**Example Scenario:**\n","```python\n","try:\n","    result = 10 / 2\n","except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n","    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Division successful, result is:\", result)\n","```\n","\n","In this example, the `else` block runs because no exception is raised.\n","\n","### 2. Nested Try-Except Blocks\n","\n","Yes, a try-except block can be nested inside another try-except block. This allows handling different exceptions at different levels of the code.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","try:\n","    try:\n","        x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n","        y = int(input(\"Enter another number: \"))\n","        result = x / y\n","    except ValueError as e:\n","        print(f\"ValueError: {e}\")\n","    else:\n","        print(\"Division successful, result is:\", result)\n","except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n","    print(f\"ZeroDivisionError: {e}\")\n","```\n","\n","### 3. Creating a Custom Exception Class\n","\n","You can create a custom exception class by inheriting from the `Exception` class.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","class MyCustomError(Exception):\n","    def __init__(self, message):\n","        self.message = message\n","        super().__init__(self.message)\n","\n","def check_positive(number):\n","    if number < 0:\n","        raise MyCustomError(\"Number must be positive\")\n","\n","try:\n","    check_positive(-5)\n","except MyCustomError as e:\n","    print(f\"Caught an exception: {e}\")\n","```\n","\n","### 4. Common Built-in Exceptions in Python\n","\n","Some common built-in exceptions include:\n","- `IndexError`\n","- `KeyError`\n","- `ValueError`\n","- `TypeError`\n","- `ZeroDivisionError`\n","- `FileNotFoundError`\n","- `IOError`\n","- `AttributeError`\n","- `ImportError`\n","\n","### 5. Logging in Python\n","\n","Logging in Python is the process of recording messages that indicate the status of an application. It's important for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications.\n","\n","### 6. Log Levels in Python Logging\n","\n","Log levels indicate the severity of events:\n","- **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n","- **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n","- **WARNING**: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future.\n","- **ERROR**: A more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n","- **CRITICAL**: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n","\n","**Examples:**\n","```python\n","import logging\n","\n","logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n","logging.info(\"This is an info message\")\n","logging.warning(\"This is a warning message\")\n","logging.error(\"This is an error message\")\n","logging.critical(\"This is a critical message\")\n","```\n","\n","### 7. Log Formatters in Python Logging\n","\n","Log formatters define the layout of log messages. You can customize the log message format using formatters.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","import logging\n","\n","formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n","\n","handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n","handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n","\n","logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n","logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n","logger.addHandler(handler)\n","\n","logger.info(\"This is an info message\")\n","```\n","\n","### 8. Setting Up Logging for Multiple Modules\n","\n","You can set up a logging configuration that can be shared across multiple modules using a configuration file or a logging configuration function.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","# main.py\n","import logging\n","import module_a\n","import module_b\n","\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n","\n","module_a.run()\n","module_b.run()\n","\n","# module_a.py\n","import logging\n","\n","logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n","\n","def run():\n","    logger.info(\"Running module A\")\n","\n","# module_b.py\n","import logging\n","\n","logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n","\n","def run():\n","    logger.info(\"Running module B\")\n","```\n","\n","### 9. Logging vs. Print Statements\n","\n","- **Logging**: Used for recording the status and history of the application. It's more flexible, can be configured to output to different destinations, and has different severity levels.\n","- **Print**: Primarily used for displaying information to the console. It doesn't provide the same level of flexibility and control as logging.\n","\n","**Use logging for:** production code, debugging complex issues, and maintaining application logs.\n","**Use print for:** quick debugging and scripts that are not intended to be maintained.\n","\n","### 10. Logging a Message to a File\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","import logging\n","\n","logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s', filemode='a')\n","logging.info(\"Hello, World!\")\n","```\n","\n","### 11. Logging Errors to Console and File\n","\n","**Example:**\n","```python\n","import logging\n","import sys\n","\n","# Configure logging to file and console\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', handlers=[\n","    logging.FileHandler(\"errors.log\"),\n","    logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)\n","])\n","\n","try:\n","    x = 1 / 0\n","except Exception as e:\n","    logging.error(f\"Exception occurred: {e}\", exc_info=True)\n","```\n","\n"]}]}
