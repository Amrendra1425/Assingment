Here's an overview of the questions along with brief explanations and code snippets where relevant:\n","\n","### Q.1. What are keywords in Python? Using the keyword library, print all the Python keywords.\n","**Answer:** Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning to the interpreter. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.\n","\n","```python\n","import keyword\n","print(keyword.kwlist)\n","```\n","\n","### Q.2. What are the rules to create variables in Python?\n","**Answer:**\n","1. Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n","2. The rest of the name can contain letters, numbers, or underscores.\n","3. Variable names are case-sensitive.\n","4. Reserved words (keywords) cannot be used as variable names.\n","\n","### Q.3. What are the standards and conventions followed for the nomenclature of variables in Python to improve code readability and maintainability?\n","**Answer:**\n","1. **Snake Case:** Use lowercase letters separated by underscores (e.g., `variable_name`).\n","2. **Descriptive Names:** Use meaningful and descriptive names.\n","3. **Constants:** Use all uppercase letters separated by underscores (e.g., `CONSTANT_NAME`).\n","4. **Private Variables:** Start with a single underscore (e.g., `_private_var`).\n","5. **Avoid Single Letters:** Except for counters or iterators (e.g., `i`, `j`).\n","\n","### Q.4. What will happen if a keyword is used as a variable name?\n","**Answer:** Using a keyword as a variable name will result in a syntax error because keywords have predefined meanings and uses in Python.\n","\n","### Q.5. For what purpose `def` keyword is used?\n","**Answer:** The `def` keyword is used to define a function in Python.\n","\n","### Q.6. What is the operation of this special character ‘\\’?\n","**Answer:** The backslash `\\` is used as an escape character in strings, allowing for the inclusion of special characters (e.g., `\\n` for newline, `\\t` for tab).\n","\n","### Q.7. Give an example of the following conditions:\n","(i) **Homogeneous list:** A list with elements of the same type.\n","```python\n","homogeneous_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","```\n","(ii) **Heterogeneous set:** A set with elements of different types.\n","```python\n","heterogeneous_set = {1, \"hello\", 3.14}\n","```\n","(iii) **Homogeneous tuple:** A tuple with elements of the same type.\n","```python\n","homogeneous_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n","```\n","\n","### Q.8. Explain the mutable and immutable data types with proper explanation & examples.\n","**Answer:**\n","- **Mutable Data Types:** These can be changed after creation. Examples include lists, sets, and dictionaries.\n","  ```python\n","  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","  my_list[0] = 4  # List is mutable\n","  ```\n","- **Immutable Data Types:** These cannot be changed after creation. Examples include strings, tuples, and integers.\n","  ```python\n","  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","  # my_tuple[0] = 4  # This will raise an error because tuples are immutable\n","  ```\n","\n","### Q.9. Write a code to create the given structure using only for loop.\n","**Structure:**\n","```\n","height = 5\n","for i in range(height):\n","        # Print leading spaces\n","        for j in range(height - i - 1):\n","            print(\" \", end=\"\")\n","        # Print stars\n","        for k in range(2 * i + 1):\n","            print(\"*\", end=\"\")\n","        # Move to the next line\n","        print()\n","```\n","\n","### Q.10. Write a code to create the given structure using while loop.\n","**Structure:**\n","```\n","n=5\n","for i in range (n):\n","  for k in range (n+i+1):\n","    print(\" \",end=\"\")\n","  for j in range (9-2*i):\n","    print(\"|\",end=\"\")\n","  print()\n","  ```\n","\n","These explanations and code snippets cover the fundamental Python concepts asked in the questions from the document."],"metadata":{"id":"lJwZ9Emah7NS"}}]}
