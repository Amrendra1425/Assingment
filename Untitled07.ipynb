Differences Between Operators\n","(i) **‘/’ vs. ‘//’**\n","- `/` is the division operator that performs floating-point division. For example, `10 / 3` results in `3.3333333333333335`.\n","- `//` is the floor division operator that performs division and then rounds down to the nearest integer. For example, `10 // 3` results in `3`.\n","\n","(ii) **‘**’ vs. ‘^’**\n","- `**` is the exponentiation operator. For example, `2 ** 3` means `2` raised to the power `3`, which is `8`.\n","- `^` is the bitwise XOR operator. It compares the corresponding bits of two numbers and returns `1` for each bit position where the corresponding bits are different. For example, `2 ^ 3` results in `1` (binary `10 ^ 11 = 01`).\n","\n","### Q.3. Logical Operators\n","- **and**: Returns `True` if both statements are true. Example: `True and False` returns `False`.\n","- **or**: Returns `True` if one of the statements is true. Example: `True or False` returns `True`.\n","- **not**: Reverses the result, returns `False` if the result is true. Example: `not True` returns `False`.\n","\n","### Q.4. Shift Operators\n","- **Right Shift Operator (`>>`)**: Shifts the bits of the number to the right by the specified number of positions. For example, `8 >> 2` shifts the bits of `8` (which is `1000` in binary) two places to the right, resulting in `2` (which is `10` in binary).\n","\n","  ```python\n","  result = 8 >> 2\n","  print(result)  # Output: 2\n","  ```\n","\n","- **Left Shift Operator (`<<`)**: Shifts the bits of the number to the left by the specified number of positions. For example, `3 << 2` shifts the bits of `3` (which is `11` in binary) two places to the left, resulting in `12` (which is `1100` in binary).\n","\n","  ```python\n","  result = 3 << 2\n","  print(result)  # Output: 12\n","  ```\n","\n","### Q.5. Check if 10 is in the List\n","```python\n","# Create a list with 15 integer elements\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]\n","\n","# Check if 10 is in the list\n","if 10 in my_list:\n","    print(\"10 is present in the list.\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"10 is not present in the list.\")\n","```\n","\n"]}]}
