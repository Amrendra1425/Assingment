Built-in Function vs. User-defined Function\n","\n","**Built-in functions** are those that are provided by Python and can be used directly without needing to define them. Examples include `print()`, `len()`, and `type()`.\n","\n","**User-defined functions** are those that you create using the `def` keyword to perform specific tasks.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","# Built-in function example\n","print(\"Hello, World!\")\n","\n","# User-defined function example\n","def greet(name):\n","    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","\n","print(greet(\"Alice\"))\n","```\n","\n","### 2. Passing Arguments to Functions\n","\n","You can pass arguments to a function in two ways: positional arguments and keyword arguments.\n","\n","- **Positional arguments** are the simplest form where you pass arguments in the same order in which parameters are defined.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","def add(a, b):\n","    return a + b\n","\n","result = add(2, 3)  # 2 and 3 are positional arguments\n","```\n","\n","- **Keyword arguments** allow you to pass arguments by explicitly naming each parameter.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","def add(a, b):\n","    return a + b\n","\n","result = add(a=2, b=3)  # a and b are keyword arguments\n","```\n","\n","### 3. Purpose of the Return Statement\n","\n","The `return` statement is used to exit a function and pass back a value to the caller. Yes, a function can have multiple return statements, but only one of them will be executed depending on the flow of control.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","def check_number(x):\n","    if x > 0:\n","        return \"Positive\"\n","    elif x < 0:\n","        return \"Negative\"\n","    else:\n","        return \"Zero\"\n","\n","print(check_number(10))\n","print(check_number(-5))\n","print(check_number(0))\n","```\n","\n","### 4. Lambda Functions\n","\n","**Lambda functions** are small anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They can have any number of arguments but only one expression.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","# Regular function\n","def add(a, b):\n","    return a + b\n","\n","# Lambda function\n","add_lambda = lambda a, b: a + b\n","\n","print(add(2, 3))        # Output: 5\n","print(add_lambda(2, 3)) # Output: 5\n","```\n","\n","Lambda functions are useful for short operations or as arguments to higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.\n","\n","Example using `filter`:\n","```python\n","numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n","print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n","```\n","\n","### 5. Scope in Python\n","\n","**Scope** determines the visibility of variables. Python uses the LEGB rule (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) to resolve variables.\n","\n","- **Local scope**: Variables defined within a function.\n","- **Global scope**: Variables defined at the top level of a script or module.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","x = \"global\"\n","\n","def my_function():\n","    x = \"local\"\n","    print(x)\n","\n","my_function()  # Output: local\n","print(x)       # Output: global\n","```\n","\n","### 6. Returning Multiple Values\n","\n","In Python, you can return multiple values from a function using tuples.\n","\n","Example:\n","```python\n","def get_coordinates():\n","    return 10, 20\n","\n","x, y = get_coordinates()\n","print(f\"x: {x}, y: {y}\")  # Output: x: 10, y: 20\n","```\n","\n","### 7. Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference\n","\n","Python uses **pass-by-object-reference**, meaning that mutable objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries) can be changed within a function, while immutable objects (e.g., integers, strings) cannot.\n","\n","Example with mutable object:\n","```python\n","def modify_list(my_list):\n","    my_list.append(4)\n","\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","modify_list(my_list)\n","print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","```\n","\n","Example with immutable object:\n","```python\n","def modify_number(x):\n","    x += 1\n","\n","number = 10\n","modify_number(number)\n","print(number)  # Output: 10\n","```\n","\n","### 8. Function for Mathematical Operations\n","\n","Here's a function that performs the specified operations:\n","\n","```python\n","import math\n","\n","def math_operations(x):\n","    return {\n","        \"log\": math.log(x),\n","        \"exp\": math.exp(x),\n","        \"power\": 2**x,\n","        \"sqrt\": math.sqrt(x)\n","    }\n","\n","result = math_operations(4)\n","print(result)\n","```\n","\n","### 9. Function to Split Full Name\n","\n","Here's a function that takes a full name and returns the first and last names:\n","\n","```python\n","def split_name(full_name):\n","    parts = full_name.split()\n","    first_name = parts[0]\n","    last_name = parts[-1]\n","    return first_name, last_name\n","\n","first, last = split_name(\"John Doe\")\n","print(f\"First Name: {first}, Last Name: {last}\")\n","```\n","\n"]}]}
